# Web Based Sport Confidence Platform with Blockchain Ethereum Technology *( Blockchain-Ethereum Teknolojisi Kullanılarak Sporda Güven Platformu )*

Spor hayatına aktif olarak devam eden sporcuların güncel ve geçmiş verilerini hizmet verdikleri veya verecekleri kurumlarla güvenli bir şekilde paylaşımını ve takibini sağlayan; böylece güvenli bir şekilde para transferlerinin gerçekleşmesine zemin hazırlayan uygulamadır.

## Getting Started

## Applications and Requirements ( Kullanılan Gerekli Uygulamalar )

* [Solidity Programming Language]() (for write Smart Contracts on Ethereum)
* [MetaMask]() ( for Wallet Management with Ethereum )
* [Intellij IDEA]() ( for Spring Java Web Application Development ) 
* [Vue.js]()
            
* [SDKMan]() [ ( The Software Development Kit Manager )]( )

    SDKMAN! is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix based systems. It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. Formerly known as GVM the Groovy enVironment Manager, it was inspired by the very useful RVM and rbenv tools, used at large by the Ruby community. 

* [Web3JS]() ( for will use Transaction Register to Ethereum Blockchain Platform ) 
* [PostgreSQL Database]()
* [Truffle]() :
        Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier. With Truffle, you get: 
        
        - Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.
        - Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai.
        - Configurable build pipeline with support for custom build processes.
        - Scriptable deployment & migrations framework.
        - Network management for deploying to many public & private networks.
        - Interactive console for direct contract communication.
        - Instant rebuilding of assets during development.
        - External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.
    ### Truffle Install
        $ npm install -g truffle
    ### Truffle Quick Usage
    For a default set of contracts and tests, run the following within an empty project directory:

        $ truffle init 
    From there, you can run truffle compile, truffle migrate and truffle test to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.

    Truffle comes bundled with a local development blockchain server that launches automatically when you invoke the commands above. If you'd like to configure a more advanced development environment we recommend you install the blockchain server separately by running npm install -g ganache-cli at the command line.

    ganache-cli: a command-line version of Truffle's blockchain server.

    ganache: A GUI for the server that displays your transaction history and chain state.
